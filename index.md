Hello!

My name is Reski Hasan. I am an English teacher. I received my Bachelor's degree in English Education from Indonesia Open University in 2013. Currently, I am teaching at a junior high school in a rural village in Sumatra, SMP Negeri 1 Rao. I have a strong interest in English language teaching, and I believe that education is the key to unlocking doors of success for every individual. I am dedicated to providing engaging and meaningful learning experiences for all my students.

In addition to teaching, I am also active as a freelancer in various writing and translation projects. I enjoy new challenges and always strive to improve my English language skills. If you'd like to know more about me or have any questions, feel free to contact me through the form in the "Contact" section.
